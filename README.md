### I guess I should put something here lol

I'm Fotis, currently an <b>undergraduate student in the Aristotle University's Computer Science Department</b>, avid <i>videogames</i> and <i>anime</i> fan. I currently work with a few other people in a small full stack developer team and have experience with a plethora of programming languages, but I mostly code in <b>TypeScript/JavaScript in my spare time using frameworks such as Angular, Ionic React etc</b>.

So uh yea thats basically it.
