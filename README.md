**fmalakis/fmalakis** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I'm Fotis, currently an undergraduate student in the Aristotle University's Computer Science Department, avid videogames and anime fan. I currently work with a few other people in a small full stack developer team and have experience with a plethera of programming languages, but I mostly code in TypeScript/JavaScript in my spare time using frameworks such as Angular, Ionic React etc.

So uh yea thats basically it.
