### I guess I should put something here lol

I'm Fotis, currently an undergraduate student in the Aristotle University's Computer Science Department, avid videogames and anime fan. I currently work with a few other people in a small full stack developer team and have experience with a plethera of programming languages, but I mostly code in TypeScript/JavaScript in my spare time using frameworks such as Angular, Ionic React etc.

So uh yea thats basically it.
